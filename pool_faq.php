                        <dt>Q. WHAT IS AUTOMATION?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Automation gives you push button control over pool and spa operation plus heater and blower control, either with a hand- held remote control or from an in-house wall-mounted panel. No more walking out to the pool equipment to turn on the heater or a spa operation. You can also control these and other operations from your computer tablet or cell phone.</dd>
                        <dt>Q. WHAT IS TOTAL ALKALINITY?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Total alkalinity (TA) is the measure of water’s resistance to changes in pH levels. A pool’s TA indicates the amount of alkali (not to be confused with the alkaline) in the form of bicarbonates, carbonates and hydroxides present in the pool water. A proper TA level helps to control pH balance, staining of surfaces, and corrosion of the pool equipment. Automation takes the work out of the pool and spa ownership by automating all work intensive functions, such as sanitation, balancing pH, cleaning and filtration.</dd>
                        <dt>Q. WHAT IS A SALT POOL OR SALT-WATER CHLORINATOR?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Salt water chlorination is a process that uses dissolved salt as a store for the pools chlorination system. The chlorine generator (also known as a salt cell, salt generator or salt chlorinator) uses electrolysis in the presence of dissolved salt, or sodium chloride to produce hypochlorous acid and sodium hypochlorite, which are the sanitizing agents already commonly used in swimming pools. A saltwater pool is not actually chlorine-free; it simply utilizes a chlorine generator instead of direct addition of chlorine.</dd>

                        <dt>Q. DO I NEED TO BRUSH MY POOL REGULARLY?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Yes. Dirt, pollen and algae will naturally collect in all the crevices of your pool, so use a pool brush to break it up. Regular churning of the water (from brushing or swimming) will give the filter an opportunity to suck up the debris before it settles.</dd>
                        <dt>Q. HOW LONG SHOULD MY FILTER RUN EACH DAY?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Your pool filter is the single most important component in keeping your swimming pool clean. Ideally a filter should run all the time for maximum circulation and debris removal. A minimum of eight hours a day in the summer, and four to five hours per day in the winter is highly recommended.</dd>
                        <dt>Q. WHAT ARE PHOSPHATES?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Phosphate is the major cause of algae in swimming pools. Phosphate and nutrients are required by all living organisms-including algae-to survive and flourish. Phosphate is introduced to pool water from a variety of sources, including rain, runoff from lawns and gardens, fertilizers, birdseed, plant material, dust, suntan oil and leaves. All of these sources will cause a build up and increase the concentration of phosphate in the water, which promotes progressive algae growth.<br>There are phosphate removers available to reduce the level of phosphate in your swimming pool water below 100 ppm (ideally you want it as close to zero reading as possible).</dd>
                        <dt>Q. WHAT IS THE WHITE HARD MATERIAL THAT IS ON MY TILE?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> That is called efflorescence, and it comes from the grout. This unsightly buildup can be removed with special products. It is not a problem caused by the pool chemistry.</dd>

                        <dt>Q. WHY DOES MY POOL HAVE A RING OF SCUM AT THE TILE?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Floating oils, dirt and waste can combine to form a scum line around the pool. This is why tile, an easily cleanable service, is placed at water level around the perimeter of the pool. There are many tile cleanser products available that may be applied with a scrubbing pad or brush and a little elbow grease.</dd>
                        <dt>Q. HOW CAN I TELL IF MY POOL IS LEAKING?</dt>
                        <dd><strong>A.</strong> Normally pool water evaporation is about 1-inch to 2-inches per week. To determine if you have a leak you can perform at a simple bucket test using an ordinary plastic bucket: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bring pool water to the normal level. Which is the middle of the skimmer.</li>
                            <li>Place a button on the first or second step of the pool.</li>
                            <li>Fill the bucket with pool water to the same level as the pool.</li>
                            <li>Mark the water level on the inside of the bucket.</li>
                            <li>Shut off the pump and mark the pool water level on the outside of the bucket.</li>
                            <li>Resume normal pump operation.</li>
                        </ol>
                        After 24 to 48 hours, compare the two water levels:
                        <br>
                        If the pool water level (outside the mark) goes down more than the water level inside the bucket, you probably have a leak.
                        <br>
                        In case of rain repeat the test (to be sure that your pool is equipped with an auto- fill to shut off the water supply).
                        <br>
                        <small>This test is invalid after 48 hours.</small></dd>
